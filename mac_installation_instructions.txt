Installing pygame on your macintosh gives a few interesting options, based on
your version. That said, I'm going to start with how you find your version
number, and we'll go from there.

1. Click on the apple icon in the upper left corner of your screen.
2. Click "About This Mac". It will likely be the first option.
3. There should be an apple icon occupying most of the window that pops up.
Below the apple are the words "Mac OS X". Below that is says "Version" and your
version number. Only the first two numbers in version are important. I see
"Version 10.5.8" so my version number is 10.5. Remember your version number for
later.

Actually Installing Pygame
############################

1. Download the appropriate version of python. You definitely want python 2.7
(which can be 2.7.1 or above, as long as it's still 2.7). If your Mac version
number is less than 10.6, you will want the corresponding version, which can be
found here:
http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.2/python-2.7.2-macosx10.3.dmg
If your version number is 10.6 or higher, you will want this link instead:
http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.2/python-2.7.2-macosx10.6.dmg

2. Install python to the default location.

3. Once python is installed, open a terminal and make sure you have the right version of python selected by typing the following line:
python
if you get a prompt that looks like the following:
>>>
then python is working. There should also be some header text above the prompt,
which indicates what version of python you are running. the header should start
with "Python 2.7". Mine starts with "Python 2.7.2" which does indeed start with
"Python 2.7".
If the version is not python 2.7, then you don't have the right version of
python selected. Try the "Selecting the right version of Python" section in
this guide.

4. Next, install pygame. For this guide, you will want the following link:
http://pygame.org/ftp/pygame-1.9.1release-python.org-32bit-py2.7-macosx10.3.dmg
That will work for any version of OSX beyond 10.3.

5. At this point, you should be done. Open at terminal and type the following
line:
python
then this line:
import pygame
If you don't get any errors, you're good. If you do get errors and you followed
the directions to this point, pygame may be installed in the wrong location.
