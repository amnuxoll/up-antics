Installing pygame on your macintosh gives a few interesting options, based on
your version. That said, I'm going to start with how you find your version
number, and we'll go from there.

1. Click on the apple icon in the upper left corner of your screen.
2. Click "About This Mac". It will likely be the first option.
3. There should be an apple icon occupying most of the window that pops up.
Below the apple are the words "Mac OS X". Below that is says "Version" and your
version number. Only the first two numbers in version are important. I see
"Version 10.5.8" so my version number is 10.5. Remember your version number for
later.

Actually Installing Pygame
############################

1. Download the appropriate version of python. You definitely want python 2.7
(which can be 2.7.1 or above, as long as it's still 2.7). If your Mac version
number is less than 10.6, you will want the corresponding version, which can be
found here:
http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.2/python-2.7.2-macosx10.3.dmg
If your version number is 10.6 or higher, you will want this link instead:
http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.2/python-2.7.2-macosx10.6.dmg

2. Install python to the default location.

3. Once python is installed, open a terminal and make sure you have the right version of python selected by typing the following line:
python -V
The output you get should look something like "Python 2.7.x", where x is any number greater than 0, but most likely less than 10.
If the version is not python 2.7.x, then you don't have the right version of
python selected. Try the "Selecting the right version of Python" section in
this guide.

4. Next, install pygame. For this guide, you will want the following link:
http://pygame.org/ftp/pygame-1.9.1release-python.org-32bit-py2.7-macosx10.3.dmg
That will work for any version of OSX beyond 10.3.

5. At this point, you should be done. Open at terminal and type the following
line:
python
then this line:
import pygame
If you don't get any errors, you're good. If you do get errors and you followed
the directions to this point, pygame may be installed in the wrong location.

Installing Pygame for macports
############################

1. Actually, I'm considering removing this.
The mac I got a hold of didn't play nice with
macports, and I don't have time to fix it right now.

############################
Installing Pygame without installing python
(Mac Version 10.6 or greater only)
############################
1. If you have OSX version 10.6, install pygame from here:
http://www.pygame.org/ftp/pygame-1.9.2pre-py2.6-macosx10.6.mpkg.zip
If you have OSX 10.7, use this pygame instead:
http://www.pygame.org/ftp/pygame-1.9.2pre-py2.7-macosx10.7.mpkg.zip

2. As long as you haven't changed the system python, you should now be able to do
step 5 of "Actually Installing Pygame". If so, you're done. If not,  use the following section
"Selecting the right version of Python" to select your system python (2.6 for OSX 10.6, or 2.7 for OSX 10.7).

############################
Selecting the right version of Python
(possibly requires Mac Version 10.6)
############################

1. Type the following line into your terminal:
defaults write com.apple.versioner.python Version 2.7
typing "python -V" should now return a 2.7.x version of python


Important Addendum (thank you to Chris Workman):  Use the 32 bit
version!

It's worth-noting for OS X users, Apple has shipped with Python2.7.2, BUT the 64-bit version.  Pygame is 32-bit.  I've installed probably 50 libraries before and never ran into this problem.  I kept searching through the Antic documentation and didn't think I needed to re-install because all it said was I needed version 2.7.x, which I had.  OS X users Need to install python from the link in that documentation because thats for the 32-bit version.  On top of that, when one tries to "import pygame" from the python prompt, at first they will get an error message saying the module can't be found.  Usually this is due to the module not being in the SYSPATH.  This time, it wasn't the case.  Normally, to activate python, one just has to type "python" from command line.  Because we need the 32-bit version, students need to type "python2.7-32" instead of just "python" (which activates the default (2.7 64)).  Only when this is done does the pygame module show up as being installed and importable.  I take it this probably wasn't a a huge issue for OS X users two years ago because most users at that time had OS versions which shipped with python 32 bit.  So, in summary

1) OS X users need to install the 32 bit version of 2.7, which is the
link in the documentation.

2) When activating python, one needs to type "python2.7-32" instead of
simply "python"


Only then is the pygame module recognizable.
