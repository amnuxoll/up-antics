The most important detail to be aware of here, is that pygame is only compiled
to run in 32-bit mode at the moment. 64-bit computers will still run it, so
don't worry about having to drop this AI class (there are 64 bit pre-release
binaries, but I don't want to mess with those). That said, you're probably
going to want to download python from the links I provided, even if you already
have python.
remember: DOWNLOAD 32-BIT!

1. Start by downloading python 2.7 (32-bit) from the link I provided. Any
    version of 2.7 will do. I used 2.7.2, but I imagine 2.7.1 and 2.7.3 if it
    ever comes out will work equally well.

2. Install the version of python you downloaded.

3. Next, download pygame 1.9.1 (32-bit) from the provided link. 1.9.2a0 would
    work too, but you don't necessarily need it.

4. Begin to install your downloaded version of pygame. When pygame asks you
    where you want to install, check your available options. If you downloaded
    the correct version of python, one of the options will be
    "python 2.7 from registry". Choose this option. If you downloaded the wrong
    version of python, the only option will be "python from another location".

5. If everything has gone smoothly up to this point, you're almost golden!
    There's just one more change I want to make. Currently python isn't on your
    path (or at least it shouldn't be), which means that you can't use the
    command line (terminal) to run python programs. This will hurt you in the
    end because you won't be able to get much information when your AI fails.
    The reason being that the terminal running python will close since it is
    only dedicated to that instance of python. We're now going to add python to
    your system path!
    By the way, there is no action to be taken in the above step. it's just
    informative.

6. You first need to navigate to your "system properties" window. Typically
    this can be achieved by right-clicking on "My Computer" or "Computer" and
    clicking "Properties", but on some distributions of Windows, you need to
    click "Advanced system settings" in the sidebar on the window that pops up.

7. If your don't like the GUI, or you're lost, try the following to get the
    window: hold the windows key and press "r". That will bring up a window
    called "run". Copy and paste the following line into the text field in
    "run":
    rundll32.exe shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL sysdm.cpl,0

8. Now go to the "advanced" tab on the "System Properties" window. Click
    "Environment Variables".

9. In the resulting window are two fields:
    "User variables for <your username>" and "System Variables". You want to
    find the "path" variable in the user variables.

10. Find out where you installed python. This is often an issue for people with
    multiple python installations. pygame only installs into one of your python
    installation, so if you have python installed in multiple places on your
    computer, you can try using one only to realize:
    "Oh no! I can't use pygame!" To circumvent that, make sure you find your
    32-bit installation of python.
    This was another block of text that required no action and just explained
    things, courtesy of Cole Mercer.

11. One way to find out if the python version you've decided on is the right
    one, is to test it out. Navigate to the directory and run "python.exe". In
    the reulting terminal, you should see some header text that starts with
    "Python 2.7.2" (it's .2 for me because I didn't use 2.7.1) and includes
    "32 bit" somwhere later on.

12. In the terminal, type the following line:
    import pygame
    If you don't get an error, this is the right installation. If you do get an
    error, go find another python installation somwhere else on your computer,
    and try again from step 11.

13. Once you find the right directory, copy its path. for example, my python
    path is "C:\Python27". Inside this directory you can find "python.exe".

14. Migrate back to your environment variables window, select "path" click
    "edit", put a semicolon at the end of the path, and then paste your python
    path right after the semicolon. After that, press ok until you're out of
    system properties.

15. Finally, open up a terminal and type the following line:
    python
    if that works, :), if not, :(. then type this next line:
    import pygame
    if that doesn't give you an error, you can go to town. Try to use the
    terminal to run aNTiCS, because that will give you more information
    about failures.

16. BTW, in order to run aNTiCS from the terminal, just type "python" then
    press the spacebar, then drag Game.py from your aNTiCS folder onto your
    terminal, the press the enter key.

17. If you've reached this step, your attention span is truly something to be
    admired. Give yourself a pat on the back and have fun playing aNTiCS!
