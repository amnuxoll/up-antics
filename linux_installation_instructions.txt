LINUX INSTRUCTIONS
##################
Disclaimer:  These instructions are provided as a courtesy.  They do
not obligate the instructor to help you debug your installation.  If
you are having difficulty, use the computer lab instead of your
personal computer.

Note:  These instructions were written for Debian based distros (e.g.,
Ubuntu).  You'll have to interpret for other distros.

1. In most cases, python 2.7.x should already have been installed with
   your OS.  To verify this, simply run 'python -V' in a terminal
   window.  If you don't have it, then you can probably install it via
   this command:
      sudo apt-get install python
   Or install manually by downloading here:
      https://www.python.org/downloads/
   Important: Do not download version 3.x.

3. Next, install pygame 1.9.1 using this command:
         sudo apt-get install python-pygame
   Or install manually by downloading here:
         http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml    

4.  Verify your pygame install is working by executing this command in
    a terminal:
        echo "import pygame" | python
    Verify that doesn't give you an error message.

5.  Download aNTiCS from the course website and unzip the folder in a
    convenient location.  This should create a folder named Antics.
    
6.  To run aNTiCS from the command prompt, navigate to your antics
    folder and enter this command:
        "python Game.py"
